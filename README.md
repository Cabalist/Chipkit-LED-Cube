The_Big_Show no longer represents the maximum number of animations, music support etc. that we can cram onto a single progam.

So we have generated a whole bunch of new animations. For those still using the UNO32, I am releasing these new animations as a new download called Another_Big_Show. And for those of you who have upgraded to the uC32, we have another new download - The Super_Big_Show! It has all the animations in The Big Show and Another Big Show, plus some other stuff. It's 187K of program memory, so it far exceeds the available memory on the UNO32, but on the uC32, there is still plenty of room for future expansion. The Super_Big_Show takes over 25 minutes to run through 49 different animations before starting to repeat.

There is not a lot to say about the Super Big Show other than it combines The_Big_Show and Another_Big_Show to give us a combination of animations that no longer fit on the ChipKit UNO32. This show contains 49 different animation effects and takes 25 minutes before it starts to repeat!

The uC32 has twice the RAM and 4 times the progam memory of the UNO32. But it is identical to the UNO32 in every other way, so all our software runs on it without any other changes to hardware or software!
